# @Sed

We use `sed` to hide (replace with an empty string) pluses in the `diff` output.

# @ShiftOfArguments

`shift` shifts all command-line arguments to the left, so that the second argument becomes first, the third becomes second, and so on.

# @Sort

`sort` with the `-u` option sorts all found parts with `grep` removing duplicates.
