# @Diff

The `diff` command allows us to find the differences between two sorted lists.
In doing so, we use the `-u` option for the so-called "unified" output,
in which the added and removed lines are denoted by what seems to me more understandable
`+` and `-` than `>` and `<`.


# @DirectoryChecking

The `-d` option of the `test` command (which in Bash can be replaced with square brackets like here)
checks that the path exists and that it is a directory.
